This project is a pair of programs that, when used together, can convert multiple music macro language files into a single MIDI file.

The first program is “mmltomidi”, which converts a single MML file to a single-channel MIDI file.

The second program is “catmidi”, which converts multiple single-channel MIDI files to a single multi-channel MIDI file.
